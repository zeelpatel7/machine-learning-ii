## 1. Regularization with Ridge and Lasso Regressions

This assignment demonstrates the application of regularized linear regression techniques on the Diabetes dataset to predict disease progression based on clinical and physiological features. It includes comparison of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Ridge, and Lasso regression models, and visualizes how regularization affects model coefficients and feature selection.

### Key Concepts:

a. Multicollinearity detection using correlation matrices and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)  
b. Data preprocessing: scaling features, managing multicollinearity  
c. Regression techniques:
- OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)  
- Ridge Regression (L2 regularization)  
- Lasso Regression (L1 regularization with automatic feature selection)  

d. Model evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
e. Coefficient path visualization to interpret how models respond to different alpha values
